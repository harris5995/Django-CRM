Created a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web application using Django and Python with a MySQL database. I followed the Youtube tutorial posted on the freeCodeCamp.org channel. (https://youtu.be/t10QcFx7d5k?si=ik6C_7y0_y7G6TFG)

1. To run the server, type the following command into the terminal:  
python manage.py runserver (Windows) OR  python3 manage.py runserver (MacOS)

2. Then, go to http://localhost:8000

3. Users will be able to register an account and log in. Once logged in, users will be able to view the customer records table. 
By clicking either the customer ID or customer name, users will be able to add, update and delete customer records.
