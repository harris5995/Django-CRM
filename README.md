Created a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web application using Django and Python. I followed the Youtube tutorial posted on the freeCodeCamp.org channel (https://youtu.be/t10QcFx7d5k?si=ik6C_7y0_y7G6TFG).

To run the server, type into terminal:  python manage.py runserver (Windows) OR  python3 manage.py runserver (MacOS)

Then, go to http://localhost:8000

Users will be able to register an account. Once logged in, users will be able to view the customer records table. 
By clicking either the customr ID or name, users will be able to add, update and delete customer records.
